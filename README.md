<p>Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute</p>
<hr>
<p>This is my Fuel Management System website for the industry. The website shows diferent technologies of fuel tracking systems for gasolines and alternative fuels.<br>
There is information about diferent solutions like mobile truck mounts, fuel accounting and fleet preventive maintenance.<br>
The contact form allows potential customers to submit their fuel tracking needs information to get a quick quote or estimate.</p>
<h2><a id="UX_9"></a>UX</h2>
<p>My goal in the design was to provide the users a friendly and responsive site navigation with informative pictures and sections showing
our products, services and latest industry news.</p>
<p>A live demo can be found ” <a href="https://navegantemx.github.io/MegaTrak-Milestone-Project/">here</a></p>
<h2><a id="Technologies_16"></a>Technologies</h2>
<p>HTML<br>
CSS<br>
Bootstrap (4.1)</p>
<h2><a id="Features_22"></a>Features</h2>
<p>This site uses the “Navbar” feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a ‘smooth scrolling’ effect.<br>
The navbar also sticks regardless of screen’s scrolling.<br>
A “Carousel with Indicators” feature was also used from Bootstrap components.</p>
<p>Features Left to Implement:<br>
I would like to add in the future, information about the administrative software functions with sample screens, user and vehicle credentials.</p>
<h2><a id="Testing_32"></a>Testing</h2>
<p>The “News” section is intended to provide fleet managers information on the latest fuel management industry technologies.<br>
In the “Support” section, they can find information about MegaTrak’s main service support technicians as well as accesing their social media profiles via clicking on the Font Awesome icons.<br>
If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address.<br>
Furthermore, the ‘required’ attribute is added to all form input fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit.<br>
If all fields are valid, the page will reload. If potential customers are interested in contacting me, they will have to fill out all fields in order for the form to go through.<br>
By clicking on the links in the navbar, the “Smooth Scroll” effect will work regardless of whether or not you’re viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar.<br>
It allows to animate scrolling to anchor links.</p>
<p>This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.</p>
<p>During the testing phase, I realized that background pictures on the “carousel-slider” section were not showing correctly. 
Fixed this with img-fuid / background cover, property values.</p>
